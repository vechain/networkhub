#### How to submit a pull request

3. Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix based on the `main` branch.

> :information_source: Tip:
> Write your commit messages following [the git guidelines](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Contributing-to-a-Project). Use present tense and imperative verbs, e.g. "Fix bug" and not "Fixed bug" or "Fixes bug.". Your commit message should describe what the commit, when applied, does to the code â€“ not what you did to the code.

- Code formatting rules (e.g., indentation, line length, etc.).
- Naming conventions for variables, functions, classes, etc.
- Commenting guidelines, including when and how to write comments.
- Test-writing guidelines, including test coverage requirements.

If the project uses a specific code formatter or linter, please ensure your contributions pass these checks before submitting a pull request.
